## Definition

> **RAG**
>
> Retrieval Augmented Generation is the methodological approach of enhancing the parametric memory of an LLM by creating access to an explicit non-parametric memory, from which a retriever can fetch relevant information, augment that information to the prompt, pass the prompt to an LLM to enable the LLM to generate a response that is contextual, reliable, and factually accurate.
