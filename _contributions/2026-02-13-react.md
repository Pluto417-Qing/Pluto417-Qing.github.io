Contributing to React, the popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. My contributions include bug fixes, documentation improvements, and helping with issue triage.

React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes.
