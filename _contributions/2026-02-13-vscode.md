Contributing to the world's most popular open source code editor. My work focuses on improving the user experience, fixing bugs, and enhancing performance.

VS Code is a powerful, lightweight code editor that runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux. It comes with built-in support for JavaScript, TypeScript, and Node.js and has a rich ecosystem of extensions.
